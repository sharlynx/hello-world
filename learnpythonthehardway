'''
The %s specifier converts the object using str(), and %r converts it using repr().
For some objects such as integers, they yield the same result,
but repr() is special in that (for types where this is possible)
it conventionally returns a result that is valid Python syntax,
which could be used to unambiguously recreate the object it represents.
